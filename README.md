# ONU-Old-Build
The original, old build script of ONU.
Download the build file and run "chmod +x build-onu-plus.sh" and then "./build-onu-plus.sh" in an Ubuntu/Debian-based environment. After the build completes, you'll find ~/onu-linux/ONU-1.0-HydrogenPlus.iso. Test it live or install it via Calamares from the desktop.
